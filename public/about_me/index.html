                    <p>I first stepped into computer science driven by a fascination with how technology shapes societies and the belief that data-driven tools could improve people’s lives at scale. During my undergraduate years at UFMG, this curiosity evolved into a concrete mission: understanding how information flows online and how we can build systems that make the digital world more accessible, reliable, and fair. From early projects that scraped university restaurant menus to nationwide studies on misinformation, I learned that thoughtful engineering can ripple far beyond the screen.</p>
<p>Today, I am based in Belo Horizonte, completing my Master’s in Computer Science at UFMG, where I research misinformation and hate speech on social networks and explore how large language models can help make the internet a safer and more constructive space. My work blends machine learning, NLP, and data-intensive methods to investigate real-world phenomena, always with an eye toward practical impact and scientific rigor.</p>
<p>Alongside research, I work as a Data Scientist at Quaest, one of Brazil’s leading public opinion and analytics firms. There, I develop statistical, machine learning, and social media intelligence systems that support decision-making in high-stakes environments, from electoral studies to brand-safety investigations. I enjoy tackling complex problems and building solutions that scale, always looking for the next challenge where data, AI, and thoughtful engineering can meaningfully improve the world around us.</p>
